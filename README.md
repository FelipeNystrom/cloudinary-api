## Cloudinary image and video handling API

A small API for image and video uploading on Cloudinary. This API is to be used as a microservice that only handles image and video storage manipulation on Cloudinary. It is customizable through dynamic input of destination folder. And is restricted through an array of confirmed clients that is handled through CORS npm package.

**work in progress**
